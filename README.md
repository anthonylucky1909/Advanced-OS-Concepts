## 📚 Project Overview

This project contains **lab experiments** on building **bootloaders**, **kernels**, and **user applications**.  
The goal is to learn:

* System bootstrapping  
* Kernel development  
* User-level applications in simulated or embedded environments  

---

## 🗂️ Directory Structure

- **lab1**: Basic app, bootloader, utilities  
- **lab2**: App, bootloader, kernel, utilities  
- **lab3**: App, app_print, bootloader, kernel, utilities  
- **lab4**: App, test, bootloader, kernel, utilities  

---

## 🔑 Key Components

- **Bootloader**: Loads OS/app into memory  
- **Kernel**: Core OS handling resources & system calls  
- **Application**: User-level programs  
- **Utilities**: Scripts for building and configuration  

---

## 🏗️ Usage

1. Run `make` in each lab directory to build  
2. Test in a simulator or on hardware
